    "My project is going to be about biological predictors for Parkinson's Disease. Parkinson's is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by involuntary mtotor functions and has no known cure. The best treatment for this disease is to catch it early to slow down its effects, and to do that more effectively, predictors must be tested with significance against the diagnosis to improve rates that it is found early on."
